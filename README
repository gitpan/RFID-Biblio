NAME
    RFID::Biblio - perl tools to use different RFID readers for library use

DESCRIPTION
    Main idea is to develop simple API to reader, and than provide useful
    abstractions on top of it to quickly write applications to respond on
    tags which come in range of RFID reader using RFID::Biblio::Reader.

    Writing support for new RFID readers should be easy.
    RFID::Biblio::Reader::API provides documentation on writing support for
    different readers.

    Currently, two serial RFID readers based on RFID::Biblio::Reader::Serial
    are implemented:

    *   RFID::Biblio::Reader::3M810

    *   RFID::Biblio::Reader::CPRM02

    There is also simple read-only reader using shell commands in
    RFID::Biblio::Reader::librfid.

    For implementing application take a look at RFID::Biblio::Reader

    `scripts/RFID-JSONP-server.pl' is example of such application. It's
    local interface to RFID reader and JSONP REST server.

    `examples/koha-rfid.js' is jQuery based JavaScript code which can be
    inserted in Koha Library System to provide overlay with tags in range
    and check-in/check-out form-fill functionality.

    Applications can use RFID::Biblio::RFID501 which is some kind of
    semi-standard 3M layout or blocks on RFID tags.
